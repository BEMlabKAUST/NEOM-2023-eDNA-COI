Understanding how reef-associated biodiversity responds to seascape features is essential for monitoring and conserving coral reef ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) from seawater offers a powerful approach to capture eukaryotic diversity in marine environments. However, its relationship with the benthic components of the reef remains poorly understood. Here we conducted simultaneous eDNA metabarcoding analysis of seawater samples and benthic photoquadrat surveys across 12 coral reef sites in the northern Red Sea. The sites represented a range of benthic habitat types and were located across three subregions: the Gulf of Aqaba, nearshore Northern Red Sea (NRS), and offshore NRS. We examined whether visual assessments of benthic communities and eukaryotic communities revealed by eDNA show consistent spatial structuring across subregions, and whether benthic cover explains patterns of eDNA signals. Our results show that eDNA detected fine-scale spatial patterns across the three subregions, but there was no significant correlation between benthic community composition and eukaryotic community dissimilarity. However, taxon-specific relationships were observed where abundance increased at degraded or low-complexity habitats. Further we investigated the complementarity of both methods for detecting ecologically relevant and cryptic reef taxa. While traditional photoquadrat surveys captured dominant benthic groups such as hard corals and algae, eDNA revealed a broader spectrum of eukaryotic taxa, including planktonic and cryptic organisms. Notably, eDNA detected organisms overlooked by visual surveys, even where it was present but not recorded in photoquadrats. Our results demonstrate the value of combining eDNA and traditional benthic assessments to improve the resolution and completeness of coral reef biodiversity monitoring. While eDNA alone may not serve as a proxy for benthic structure, its fine-spatial resolution and ability to capture hidden biological patterns makes it an essential complement to visual surveys. Integrating both approaches will be key to supporting seascape-scale ecological understanding and informing conservation efforts in dynamic and understudied reef systems.
